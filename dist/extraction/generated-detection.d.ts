/**
 * Generated-file detection for symbol-disambiguation down-ranking.
 *
 * When a query like "Send" matches 17 symbols across protobuf scaffolding,
 * test mocks, and the hand-written implementation, the FTS ranker often
 * surfaces the generated stubs first because their names are identical
 * to the implementation's name (validated empirically on cosmos-sdk —
 * see project_go_multi_module_audit memory). Generated stubs frequently
 * have no body to trace from, so the agent ends up reading source anyway.
 *
 * This is a relevance hint consulted at disambiguation time (findSymbol /
 * findAllSymbols / explore ranking / codegraph_search formatting), NOT a
 * hard filter — generated nodes are still in the graph and remain
 * reachable; they just rank LAST when there's a real implementation with
 * the same name.
 *
 * Two signals, deliberately separate:
 *
 *  1. {@link isGeneratedFile} — PATH only, pure and synchronous. Most
 *     generated files follow the `<basename>.<tool>.<ext>` convention
 *     (`.pb.go`, `_grpc.pb.go`, `.g.dart`, `_pb2.py`). Free to call
 *     anywhere, including in a sort comparator.
 *
 *  2. {@link hasGeneratedHeader} — CONTENT banner in the file's head. Go's
 *     own convention is a content marker, not a filename one, so a
 *     generated `payroll.go` sitting beside hand-written use-cases is
 *     invisible to (1) — that is issue #1500. Evaluated ONCE at index time
 *     (the file's content is already in memory for parsing) and persisted
 *     on the file record as `files.generated`; readers get it from the DB
 *     rather than re-reading headers per request. See
 *     GENERATED_CONTENT_PATTERNS below for the banners recognized.
 *
 * Consumers that have a bounded candidate list should use the DB-backed
 * union (`QueryBuilder.getGeneratedPathsAmong` /
 * `CodeGraph.getGeneratedFilePaths`) so both signals apply; the path-only
 * check remains the fallback for callers with no database in hand and for
 * indexes built before the flag existed.
 *
 * NOTE for future editors: the banner literals quoted in this file sit
 * BELOW the header window this detector scans, so the module does not
 * classify itself. `generated-detection.test.ts` pins that — if you move
 * the pattern table upward, the test fails rather than the repo silently
 * demoting its own file.
