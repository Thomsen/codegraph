/**
 * Per-file allocation diagnostic for `codegraph_explore` (CG-4).
 *
 * The explore response is a fixed byte envelope (`budget.maxOutputChars`, hard-
 * capped at 25K so the host never externalizes the result). WHICH files fill it,
 * and in what proportion, is decided by a long chain of gates, tiers and caps
 * spread across `handleExplore`. That chain is currently unobservable: you can
 * read the output and guess, but you cannot say "this file took 16% of the
 * envelope and that one took 21%" without hand-counting.
 *
 * This module is the instrument. Enabled by `CODEGRAPH_EXPLORE_DEBUG`, it
 * records, for one explore call:
 *   - per candidate file: relevance score, graph (RWR) mass, distinct query-term
 *     hits, ranking flags, render mode, bytes of source actually emitted, that
 *     file's share of the final envelope, whether it was clipped, whether it
 *     carries a flow-spine symbol — and for the ones that didn't render, why;
 *   - totals: envelope vs `maxOutputChars` vs the hard ceiling, source bytes vs
 *     meta-text overhead, files considered at each filter stage, and the score
 *     floor / relevance-gate thresholds that were applied.
 *
 * HARD CONSTRAINT — this ships in the product binary: when the env var is unset
 * the diagnostic must not exist. `start()` returns `null`, every call site is a
 * `diag?.` no-op, and the agent-facing response is byte-identical. The
 * diagnostic never mutates render state, and every method is wrapped so a bug in
 * here can never fail an explore call.
 *
 * Sinks (value of `CODEGRAPH_EXPLORE_DEBUG`):
 *   `1` / `true` / `on` / `yes` / `stderr` → human-readable table on stderr
 *   `json`                                 → one JSON object on stderr
 *   anything else                          → treated as a path; one JSON object
 *                                            per line appended (JSONL sidecar)
